1) Find common elements in three sorted arrays, 3 array values are given as input to program.

Algorithm:
1)	Declare and initialize three arrays to be compared.
2)	Check if values of array 1 is equal to values of array 2 in a continues loop till loop is less than size of array.
3)	Again, check the values of array 2 is equal to array 3 in a loop.
4)	If conditions are met then swap.
5)	Print the final array which has all common values.
