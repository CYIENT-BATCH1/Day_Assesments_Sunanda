3)Write a program to Implement “Selection Sort” using Recursion for given elements:

Algorithm:

•	Initialize minimum value to location 0
•	Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array
•	While traversing if any element smaller than minimum value is found then swap both the values.
•	Then, increment minimum value to point to next element
•	Repeat until array is sorted
