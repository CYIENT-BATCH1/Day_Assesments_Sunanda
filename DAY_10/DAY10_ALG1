1)Write a function to store "G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar" and "G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint" into " G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u]" as shown below.

unsigned char G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar = 50u;
unsigned int G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint = 1000u;
unsigned char G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[5u];

Algorithm:
1)	Declare and Initialize variables as given in questions and read inputs.
2)	Shift bits of G_Eng_EngineRpm_uint, G_Eng_EngineTemperature_uchar part by part and store the output values in indexes of G_Msg_EngineInformation_Byte[], & it with correct hex value.
3)	Repeat step 3 for all the indexes and print the values of indexes of array individually.
