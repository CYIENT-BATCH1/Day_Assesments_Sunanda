Algorithm:
1)	Read input in 2D array at runtime.
2)	Check the condition where the data is less than 0x05 and more than 0XFF.
3)	If the condition is true print the time stamp where the data is noisy.
4)	Check second condition where data is less than 0x05 and greater than 0XFF.
5)	If the condition is true just break the loop and print the data which are not in the range of condition.
