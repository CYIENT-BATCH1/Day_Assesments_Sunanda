2) Write program to set (1) bits CIS, C2OUT, C1OUT in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1 bits are set to 0x06 in register “ADCON0”
Algorithm:
1)	Read input in variable called ADCON and CMCON.
2)	Check the condition whether ADCON is equal to 0x30 or 4810.
3)	If condition is true set required bits of CMCON.
4)	If condition is false print ADCON is not equal to 0x30.
