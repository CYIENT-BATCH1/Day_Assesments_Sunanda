3) Write program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0”

1)	Initialize two variable name ADCON0 and CMCON and give them input at runtime and read the values.

2)	Check if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0 i.e 2810.


3)	If condition is true clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in       
register “CMCON. To do so and(&) the CMCON value with 0XF0 to clear the rightmost 4-bits without disturbing other 4-bits.

4)	If condition fails simple get out of the loop and print “ 
“Condition Failed”.
