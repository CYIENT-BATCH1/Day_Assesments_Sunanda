1)	Realize a function which has 2 arguments and 1 return value. Argument 1 is Byte value, Argument 2 is bit position. Function has to flip the bit position (as per argument 2) in argument 1 byte value and return complete byte value.


 1)Declare and define function named flip_bits(int a, int b)  
   and pass two integer arguments a(input) and b(bit position).

2)	Create a mask to flip bits at given position by left shifting that bit by position times and store it in vaiable named mask.

3)	Now exor the input value with the mask and store it in input variable named a, this will flip the bit at given postion p.

4)	Now in driver function(main) take input at runtime and call the function flip_bits.
