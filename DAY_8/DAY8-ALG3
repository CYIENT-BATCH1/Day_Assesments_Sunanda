3) i)Set the register T0CON value such a way that bit TMR0ON and PSA bit are set    
    (1), without disturbing the other bits.

1)	Declare and initialize variable name T0CON with value 0xfa, also two more variable named pos, pos1 and initialize position bits to them.
2)	To set a bit at given bit position left shift those bits by position times and or it with the T0CON value (0xfa) and store the result in T0CON itself.
3)	Print T0CON.
